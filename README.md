# number-guessing-game
## How the game works 
  #### 1. Enter a number between 0 and 100!
  #### 2. If you guessed it right, program displays * Bingo! Congratualtion, you WON! 
  #### 3. If the number you entered is not equal to the random number, the program will tell you that your number is either above or below the random number. (This will iterate until you guess the correct number)
